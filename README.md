# Rainmeter Power plan Toggler
Play osu and get lag from desktop slideshow so I made a power plan that stop slideshow but forget to turn off so I can't see all my beautiful wallpapers so I made this rainmeter skin to remind me to toggle between those power plans.
## Now with automatic powerplan switch Rainmeter Skin!
Change **DetectProcessName** variable to the process you want to detect.The power plan will automaticaly change when you open that program!
